dsc (2.2.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.2.0

    Some big changes in this release are the removal of the C++ configure
    parser library Hapy and the addition of pcap-thread to (hopefully)
    handle capturing packet in a correct and efficiant way.

    With that addition of pcap-thread comes new runtime options:
    - `-m` sets monitor mode on interfaces
    - `-i` sets immediate mode on interfaces
    - `-T` disable the usage of threads in pcap thread

    Bugfixes:
    - d95190a fixes a small memory leak in `Pcap_init()` and a possible
      bug where `-p` might never been used because of not being declared
      external.
    - 55e1056 added check for `netinet/ip_compat.h` for use in
      `src/pcap_layers/pcap_layers.c`.

dsc (2.1.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.1.1

    Bugfixes:
    - 22688c1 Fix pcap/select last_ts
      In some cases `select` will return the fd set as if there are packets
      to read but there aren't. That would case the last timestamp to not
      advance and the `Pcap_run` loop to never finish.
      This fix add a check on packets captured and sets last timestamp if
      none where caught.
