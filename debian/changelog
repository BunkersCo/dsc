dsc (2.3.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.3.0

    Rare lockup has been fixed that could happen if a signal was received
    in the wrong thread at the wrong time due to `pcap_thread_stop()`
    canceling and waiting on threads to join again. The handling of signals
    have been improved for threaded and non-threaded operations.

    A couple of bugfixes, one to fix loading of GeoIP ASN database and
    another to use the lowest 32 bits of an IP address (being v4 or v6)
    in the IP hash making it a bit more efficient for v6 addresses.

    New functionality for the configure option `local_address`, you can now
    specify a network mask (see `man 5 dsc.conf` for syntax).

dsc (2.2.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.2.1

    Two bugfixes with one being critical (caused segfault, sorry for that)
    - `pcap-thread` had an issue that threads where not closed on exit
      of `pcap_thread_run()`, this only created many threads in my testing
      environment but reports came in that it segfaulted.
    - When started `dsc` (not in debug mode) it will wait to align with
      the time, that did not get update with the configurable interval
      change.

    Commits:

    6e3654b Fix #90: Update pcap-thread to v1.1.2 to fix a segfault issue
    c9350a3 Fix #92: Honor configured interval when aligning
    acaf617 minor typo

dsc (2.2.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.2.0

    Some big changes in this release are the removal of the C++ configure
    parser library Hapy and the addition of pcap-thread to (hopefully)
    handle capturing packet in a correct and efficiant way.

    With that addition of pcap-thread comes new runtime options:
    - `-m` sets monitor mode on interfaces
    - `-i` sets immediate mode on interfaces
    - `-T` disable the usage of threads in pcap thread

    Bugfixes:
    - d95190a fixes a small memory leak in `Pcap_init()` and a possible
      bug where `-p` might never been used because of not being declared
      external.
    - 55e1056 added check for `netinet/ip_compat.h` for use in
      `src/pcap_layers/pcap_layers.c`.

dsc (2.1.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.1.1

    Bugfixes:
    - 22688c1 Fix pcap/select last_ts
      In some cases `select` will return the fd set as if there are packets
      to read but there aren't. That would case the last timestamp to not
      advance and the `Pcap_run` loop to never finish.
      This fix add a check on packets captured and sets last timestamp if
      none where caught.

    Commits:

    d115b3f Correct configuration, missing `;`.
    22688c1 Fix pcap/select last_ts
    b6d3dd8 Fix package dependencies.
