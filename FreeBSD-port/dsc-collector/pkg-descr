dsc is a system for collecting and exploring statistics from busy
DNS servers.  It currently has two major components: collector and
presenter

The collector process uses libpcap to receive DNS messages sent and
received on a network interface.  It may run on the same machine
as the DNS server, or on another system connected to a switch
configured with port mirroring.  A configuration file defines some
number of datasets and other options.  Datasets are dumped to disk
every 60 seconds as XML files.  A cron job copies the XML files to
a separate server for archiving and further processing.
