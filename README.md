Welcome to the DSC source code repository.

DSC - DNS Stats Collector is a tool used for collecting and exploring statistics from busy DNS servers. It uses a distributed architecture with collectors running on or near nameservers sending their data to one or more central presenters for display and archiving. Collectors use pcap to sniff network traffic. They transmit aggregated data to the
presenter as XML data.  More information about DSC may be found here:

Plus there's a FAQ:

And of course mailing lists to join development discussions, which are linked from that page.
