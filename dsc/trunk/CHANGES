    Added an EDNS bufsiz indexer so we can collect buffer sizes
    advertised by clients.

    Attempt to improve portability (on Solaris) by checking for
    libresolv, libnsl, and libsocket.  Also check for statvfs() vs
    statvs() in configure.

2008-07-29 Duane Wessels

    Updates to collector/cron/upload-rsync.sh so that it behaves
    better with new date-based directories on both collector and
    presenter.

2008-06-27 Duane Wessels

    Added a source port range dataset (for about-to-be-announced
    vulnerability that can be mititgated by improving source port
    randomness).

2008-04-22 Duane Wessels

    Added ./configure script for presenter/dsc code.

2008-04-22 Duane Wessels

    Added support for capturing NCAP data streams.

2008-01-09 Duane Wessels

    Changed the location of the presenter's ".dat" files.  Previously
    there were stored in a directory such as 20080109/qtype/qtype.dat
    and now they will be moved one directory up and stored as
    20080109/qtype.dat.

    The source distribution includes a script found at
    presenter/grapher/update-dat-file-locations.sh that will traverse
    the /usr/local/dsc/data directory and move all the .dat files
    one level up.

    When upgrading to this version of DSC you should first stop the
    refile-and-grok.sh cron job, install the DSC software, and then
    run the update-dat-file-locations.sh script (after reading it).

    Data passed from collector to presenter is now contained in a
    single XML file, rather than one XML file per dataset.  This
    should significantly reduce filesystem pressure (i.e., 20x fewer
    files to be stored and sent) on both sides.

2008-01-07 Duane Wessels

    The collector now stores to-be-uploaded XML files in
    date-named subdirectories.  This reduces filesystem pressure
    in the event that the collector cannot communicate with the
    presenter for an extended period of time.

    To accomodate this change, the upload-prep.sh script has been
    replaced with a Perl version, named upload-prep.pl.  After
    installing DSC you should change your cron job to use the new
    script.

    Previously, a child was forked for each collection interval.
    Memory allocated for collected data was freed by simply exiting
    the child.  But this left no way to preserve any data across
    intervals.

    Now, interval collectors do not fork.  To avoid the tedious,
    slow, and error-prone nature of normal malloc-and-free memory
    management, we instead store non-persistent data in memory
    allocated from an "arena", which can be freed quickly and safely.
    We don't need to free individual allocations, but we do need
    to reset some pointers to allocated memory.

    TCP resets are now properly handled and TCP state is freed
    if a connection has been idle for too long.

    The collector configuration (dsc.conf) has a new 'minfree_bytes'
    directive.  If the amount of free disk space on dsc's partition
    falls below this limit, dsc will not write any XML files -- that
    data will be lost.

    The default value is 5 MB.

2007-12-14 Alexander Gall

    Added a 'dns_ip_version' indexer so that we can track DNS messages
    sent over v4 and v6.

2007-12-04 Duane Wessels

    Fixed a collector bug when listening on multiple interfaces of
    different datalink types (e.g., eth0 and lo).

2007-11-26 Duane Wessels

    Added a 'hide_nodes' feature to dsc-grapher.cfg.  If 'hide_nodes'
    is given, then the navigation menu will not display the nodes
    underneath a server.  Note, however, that knowledgeable users
    could still view individual node data by manually if they know
    the names by specifying it in the URL query terms.

2007-10-09 Duane Wessels

    Changed the presenter to not use "data URIs" by default.  Now
    Internet Explorer users should be happier.

2007/06/14 Duane Wessels

    Added -f command line option to keep 'dsc' collector as a foreground
    process.

2007-06-11 Duane Wessels

    dsc-xml-extractor.pl now looks for incoming XML files in
    "incoming/YYYY-MM-DD" directories.

2007-06-07 Duane Wessels

    New TCP code did not compile cleanly on Linux.  Added some
    #ifdefs and macros for Linux compatibility on TCP headers.

2007-05-15 Ken Keys, Duane Wessels

    TCP support
    New 'transport' indexer for DNS messages.  Indicates whether message
    arrived over UDP or TCP.

2007-04-04 Duane Wessels

    IPv6 support
    New 'ip_version' indexer.  Indicates whether DNS message arrived
    via IPv4 or IPv6.
